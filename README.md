1. Project Name - Java Chat App
   Team Name - Java Chat
   Team Members - Joe O'Brien and Ricky Hodge

2. We will be building an application in java that allows two users to chat with each other. We want to build it because it has real world application and will test our
   knowledge with java code. It will be used for communication between two users.

| - user1InputField: TextField     |
| - user2InputField: TextField     |
| - user1Name: String              |
| - user2Name: String              |
------------------------------------
| + start(primaryStage: Stage): void|
| - sendMessage(username: String,  |
|   message: String): void         |
| - appendMessage(message: String):|
|   void                           |
| - getCurrentTime(): String       |
| + main(args: String[]): void     |

4. This will require effort from both of us and will test our understanding of java. We plan to create the intial project and server side code the week of 03/11/24,
   followed by chat server the week after (Week of 3/18/24), and then the user interface the week of 03/25/24. The remaining time will be troubleshooting and corrections,
   as well as, creating a presentation up until the April 10th due date.
